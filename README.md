Pop-flip Image Streaming Service (YawningPanda)
============

Just a dump of a project that we were building at Hyperion Storm, LLC, a few years back.  It has some interesting features in terms of the user interface and how it organizes streams of images.  I lead the effort and provided the backend and iOS client, while James and Jeff helped overall architecture, design, and building of the Android client.

I'll try to update the documentation when I have time.
